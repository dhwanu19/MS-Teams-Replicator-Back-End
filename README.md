# University Project - MS Teams Replicator

## Introduction

**UNSW Beans** is a communication platform developed by the COMP1531 cohort at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), aimed at facilitating virtual collaboration and communication. The project embodies a full-stack application, with a focus on backend development using JavaScript and Express. This initiative is part of UNSW's effort to engage students in practical software development, aligning with contemporary industry practices.

## Project Overview

The project was conceived in response to the need for a budget-friendly communication tool, allowing users to share, communicate, and collaborate effectively. By replicating key features of Microsoft Teams, **UNSW Beans** provides an accessible platform for academic and project collaboration.

### Objectives

1. **Full-Stack Development**: Gain hands-on experience in developing end-user applications using software development tools.
2. **Software Testing**: Implement static, dynamic, and user testing to validate software systems.
3. **Team Functionality**: Understand and apply principles of effective teamwork, including conflict management and maintaining professional relationships.
4. **Software Analysis**: Analyse complex software systems focusing on data models and state models.
5. **Software Engineering Life Cycle**: Understand and apply iterative software development practices, including requirement elicitation and system design.
6. **Continuous Integration and Deployment**: Utilize version control and deployment tools for integrating and deploying software in a team environment.

## Iterative Development

The project was developed over multiple iterations, each adding functionality and enhancing the application:

- **Iteration 0**: Project setup and initial planning.
- **Iteration 1**: Implementation of basic functionalities and testing frameworks.
- **Iteration 2**: Development of a web server and expansion of features.
- **Iteration 3**: Finalization of the lifecycle, including advanced features, deployment, and preparation for future enhancements.

### Key Features

- User authentication and management
- Channel and DM creation and management
- Real-time messaging and communication
- Task scheduling and notifications
- File sharing and collaboration tools
- Data persistence and security measures

## Deployment

The backend of **UNSW Beans** was deployed to the cloud, ensuring accessibility from anywhere. This deployment was a critical step in making the application available for real-world use.

## Challenges and Solutions

Throughout the project, we faced various technical and team-related challenges. Through effective problem-solving, research, and collaboration, we overcame these obstacles, implementing features that exceeded project specifications.

## Quantitative Impact and Results

The project was highly successful, achieving a near-perfect score of 69/70, reflecting the quality, functionality, and impact of the UNSW Beans platform on improving virtual collaboration.

## Personal Contribution

As a team leader and key developer, I spearheaded the project's management, planning, and execution phases. My direct contributions included developing the user authentication system, real-time messaging functionality, and channel management features, utilizing my skills in JavaScript and TypeScript to implement these critical components efficiently.

## Technologies and Tools

Leveraged advanced features of JavaScript and TypeScript for backend development, focusing on creating a secure and user-friendly authentication system, enabling seamless messaging and channel operations. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding and proficiency in these languages.

## Soft Skills Demonstrated

My role as a team leader allowed me to demonstrate significant leadership skills, from coordinating tasks among team members to ensuring project milestones were met on time. I played a crucial role in fostering a collaborative environment, resolving conflicts, and guiding the team towards our collective goal.

## Reflections and Learning

The project presented numerous coordination challenges, especially in aligning team membersâ€™ schedules and dividing tasks according to individual strengths. Overcoming these hurdles taught me valuable lessons in project management, effective communication, and the importance of flexibility in team dynamics. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also sparked a profound interest in programming, particularly in exploring higher-level languages such as Python, which I am eager to pursue further.

## Future Directions

The project laid a solid foundation for future development, with plans to enhance the user interface, integrate additional collaboration tools, and improve system scalability and security.

## Conclusion

**UNSW Beans** stands as a testament to the skills and dedication of the COMP1531 cohort. It not only serves as a practical tool for communication but also as a valuable learning experience in software development, team collaboration, and project management.
