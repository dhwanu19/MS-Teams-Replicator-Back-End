# University Project - MS Teams Replicator

## Introduction

**UNSW Beans** is a communication platform developed by the COMP1531 cohort at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), aimed at facilitating virtual collaboration and communication. The project embodies a full-stack application, with a focus on backend development using JavaScript and Express. This initiative is part of UNSW's effort to engage students in practical software development, aligning with contemporary industry practices.

## Project Overview

The project was conceived in response to the need for a budget-friendly communication tool, allowing users to share, communicate, and collaborate effectively. By replicating key features of Microsoft Teams, **UNSW Beans** provides an accessible platform for academic and project collaboration.

### Objectives

1. **Full-Stack Development**: Gain hands-on experience in developing end-user applications using software development tools.
2. **Software Testing**: Implement static, dynamic, and user testing to validate software systems.
3. **Team Functionality**: Understand and apply principles of effective teamwork, including conflict management and maintaining professional relationships.
4. **Software Analysis**: Analyse complex software systems focusing on data models and state models.
5. **Software Engineering Life Cycle**: Understand and apply iterative software development practices, including requirement elicitation and system design.
6. **Continuous Integration and Deployment**: Utilize version control and deployment tools for integrating and deploying software in a team environment.

## Iterative Development

The project was developed over multiple iterations, each adding functionality and enhancing the application:

- **Iteration 0**: Project setup and initial planning.
- **Iteration 1**: Implementation of basic functionalities and testing frameworks.
- **Iteration 2**: Development of a web server and expansion of features.
- **Iteration 3**: Finalization of the lifecycle, including advanced features, deployment, and preparation for future enhancements.

### Key Features

- User authentication and management
- Channel and DM creation and management
- Real-time messaging and communication
- Task scheduling and notifications
- File sharing and collaboration tools
- Data persistence and security measures

## Deployment

The backend of **UNSW Beans** was deployed to the cloud, ensuring accessibility from anywhere. This deployment was a critical step in making the application available for real-world use.

## Challenges and Solutions

Throughout the project, we faced various technical and team-related challenges. Through effective problem-solving, research, and collaboration, we overcame these obstacles, implementing features that met or exceeded project specifications.

## Future Directions

The project laid a solid foundation for future development, with plans to enhance the user interface, integrate additional collaboration tools, and improve system scalability and security.

## Conclusion

**UNSW Beans** stands as a testament to the skills and dedication of the COMP1531 cohort. It not only serves as a practical tool for communication but also as a valuable learning experience in software development, team collaboration, and project management.
